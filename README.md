# Homekit_Fireplace_Controller

HomeKit enabled controller for a gas fireplace with a wall switch.  The system operates such that either the wall switch or Home App can turn the fireplace on and off no matter which one sent the command first.  For example you can turn the fireplace on with the wall switch and off via Siri.  

ESP32 based Homekit controller for a gas fireplace. The project uses the HomeSpan library, an I2C relay, and a momentary decorator switch.  Wiring the momentary switch to the ESP 32 allows both wall and Home app control of the fireplace
